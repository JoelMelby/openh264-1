Notes about this package
========================

The maximum version of OpenH264 that we can build is 1.5.0. Cisco introduced a
breaking change starting from 1.6.0, which means our fork of gst-plugins-bad
won't compile with that version.

In order to update OpenH264 further than 1.5.0, we need to drop our old
GStreamer forks and move to more up to date versions.
